# Document-Similarity-Topic-Modelling
1.1  Part 1 - Document Similarity
For the first part of this work, I will complete the functions doc_to_synsets and similarity_score which will be used by document_path_similarity to find the path similarity between two documents.

1.2  Part 2 - Topic Modelling
For the second part of this work, I will use Gensim's LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to model topics in newsgroup_data.
